The music contained in this release considered as the author's best works, with most complex structure, composition, arrangement, programming and sound design. You will never find anything similar these works anywhere in the mainstream, as they were crafted with extreme experimentation and creativity. But they do not belonged to the author anymore, as the author released these to the world. Everyone should have their right to share, perform, modify, sample, and own them. Everyone should have the freedom of association to use these works as much as they pleased. As ones always said, fuck any form of intellectual and private property.

**ITERATION** is a collection of works that documented the author's life journey through exploration of anarchism, with various tendencies and theories. Moreover, the focus of inspirations in these works is to find the reasons between revolution and collapse. The author believe that anarchism might have a chance to be achievable in very short time, however collapse is inevitable. They identify themself as an illegalist insurrectionary nihilist, but that does not matter, what matters is there demonstration and illustration, of anarchism and anarchy.

The author also hope that these works could inspire other musicians to explore, experiment, and expand their creativity without restriction of genres, styles or tools. All of those are social constructs, just like class, race and gender. Never let the authority and hierarchy of society hold down your creation. The author did not have any formal training, no music lesson, neither play any instrument. You have better understanding of music theory than the former creator of these works. Yet no barrier hold nor delay the creation of these works. Be yourselves and let no label stop your creativity.

The author believe that no license is necessary to be used for release freedom of these works, as there should be none of any label over any free work. However when someone attempted to copyright these works against people and stopping other from using them, all you gotta do is shove a rifle muzzle down their throat and pull the trigger. Make sure to double tap it.

But to be safe so you do not waste a bullet on some compost, tell them that these works are **Public Domain CC0** or **GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3.0** and they are the most free licenses one could think of. Free as freedom, not free beer, of course, if you know that FLOSS motto.
